## 🔐 Authentication Flow

The application uses Supabase for secure authentication with the following flow:

1. **Onboarding Check** - Verifies if user has completed the onboarding process
2. **Session Verification** - Checks for existing authenticated session in AsyncStorage
3. **Route Navigation**:
   - No user → Show onboarding (if not completed) or login
   - Authenticated user → Navigate to home feed

---

## 📦 Database Schema

The database is managed through Supabase migrations located in `supabase/migrations/`. Key tables include:

- **profiles** - User profile information including bio, avatar, and username
- **posts** - User posts with images, captions, and location data
- **comments** - Post comments and threaded discussions
- **likes** - Post likes tracking for engagement metrics

---

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- **AI-Powered Suggestions** - Smart tagging and auto-location detection using Ollama
- **Premium Subscription** - Revenue generation via RevenueCat integration
- **Analytics Dashboard** - User engagement tracking with Loops analytics
- **Real-time Notifications** - Push notifications for likes, comments, and follows
- **Advanced Search** - Filter posts by park, date, user, or trending topics

---

## 🐛 Development Best Practices

- Run `npm run typecheck` regularly to catch TypeScript errors early
- Execute `npm run lint` to maintain consistent code quality and style
- Utilize AsyncStorage for persistent local state management
- Leverage React Context API for efficient global state management
- Verify `.env.local` contains proper Supabase credentials before starting
- Monitor Jenkins pipeline for automated quality feedback after commits
